# Haversine formula to calculate the distance between two points on the Earth
def haversine(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2):
    # The Earth's radius in miles
    R = 3958.8  # This is a constant value representing the average radius of the Earth

    # Convert latitude and longitude from degrees to radians
    # Latitude and longitude are usually given in degrees, but for accurate calculations, we need to convert them to radians
    d_lat = radians(lat2 - lat1)  # Difference in latitude between the two points
    d_lon = radians(lon2 - lon1)  # Difference in longitude between the two points
    r_lat1 = radians(lat1)  # Convert the latitude of the first point to radians
    r_lat2 = radians(lat2)  # Convert the latitude of the second point to radians

    # Haversine formula to calculate the shortest distance over the Earth's surface
    # This formula is great for calculating distances between two points on a sphere, like our planet
    a = sin(d_lat / 2) ** 2 + cos(r_lat1) * cos(r_lat2) * sin(d_lon / 2) ** 2
    # 'a' is the square of half the chord length between the points.
    # It uses the differences in latitude and longitude to determine this.

    c = 2 * atan2(sqrt(a), sqrt(1 - a))
    # 'c' is the angular distance in radians, which is the central angle between the two points

    # Finally, multiply 'c' by the Earth's radius to get the distance in miles
    return R * c

# From a customer's perspective:
# - Imagine you want to know how far two places are from each other.
# - For instance, you want to know the distance from your home to the nearest grocery store.
# - The Haversine formula helps calculate this distance accurately by considering the Earth's curvature.

# Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:
# 1. Convert the latitude and longitude of both locations from degrees to radians.
#    - Why? Because mathematical functions like sine and cosine work with radians, not degrees.
# 2. Calculate the difference in latitude and longitude between the two points.
# 3. Use the Haversine formula to find 'a', which gives you an idea of the relative distance between the points.
# 4. Calculate 'c', the central angle, which tells you how far apart the two points are on the Earth's surface.
# 5. Multiply 'c' by the Earth's radius to convert this angle into a distance in miles.

# This means, with just the coordinates of two places, you can find out how far apart they are, helping you make decisions about travel or logistics.

            distance = haversine(locations[location_keys[i]][0], locations[location_keys[i]][1], locations[location_keys[j]][0], locations[location_keys[j]][1])
            distance_matrix[i, j] = distance  # Store the distance in the matrix
            distance_matrix[j, i] = distance  # Since distance from i to j is the same as from j to i, store it symmetrically

    return distance_matrix  # Return the matrix containing distances between all pairs of locations

# From a customer's perspective:
# - This function helps us figure out how far apart each pair of locations is.
# - It's like creating a table that tells us the distance from every place to every other place.
# - For example, if you want to know how far your home is from each store, this function calculates that for you.

# Here's a step-by-step breakdown:
# 1. **Number of Locations**: We count how many places we're dealing with.
# 2. **Distance Matrix**: We create a table (matrix) to store distances between every pair of locations.
# 3. **Location Names**: We list all the location names (like Home, Cardenas, Vons, etc.).
# 4. **Calculate Distances**: We loop through each pair of locations and calculate the distance using the Haversine formula.
#    - This part does the heavy lifting, calculating how far each place is from every other place.
# 5. **Symmetry**: We store each distance in the matrix in both directions (from i to j and from j to i) because the distance is the same either way.
# 6. **Return the Matrix**: Finally, we return the table with all the distances.

# Why is this important?
# - It helps in planning your shopping trip by knowing exactly how far each store is.
# - By having all distances, you can decide the best route to take to minimize travel time and cost.
# - Essentially, it makes your shopping more efficient and convenient.
